===================

Learn something true. Every day.
We love Africa: everything about the place makes us go gaga!

So we thought, let's take *one* of African's amazing things, and tell the world about it. Hence "kasahorow" which means "many languages" in Akan, a language of Africa.

So learn something true everyday. And share in Akan, Chewa, Ga-Dangme, Gbe, Gikuyu, Hausa, Igbo, Lingala, Luganda, Luwo, Malagasy, Oromo, Swahili, Wolof, Yoruba, or Zulu.
